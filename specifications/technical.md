## Machine learning - Filip

We want to run the machine learning model to detect a face and detect facial features to detect basic emotions a human is displaying (happiness, sadness, etc...)

Example can be found here: https://geekyhumans.com/emotion-detection-using-python-and-deepface/

Machine learning model and face detection will run on the host machine and send data 

## Drone control - Mislav

We would like to have the drone follow the face as it moves around the room

The flow would be

- aquire lock
- follow target
- attempt to seek target if lost
