## Machine learning - Filip

We want to run the machine learning model to detect a face and detect facial features to detect basic emotions a human is displaying (happiness, sadness, etc...)

Example can be found here: https://geekyhumans.com/emotion-detection-using-python-and-deepface/

Machine learning model and face detection will run on the host machine and send data
